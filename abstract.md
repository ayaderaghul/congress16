## Abstract
Bargaining is an important problem in economics literature. We simulate a population of agents adopting
different strategies of the repeated Nash Demand Game and let it evolve. The result suggests that, when
the game is a one-shot bargain, the 50-50 division is very stable. However, when the game is repeated
(and/or the discount factor is sufficiently high), the 50-50 share is not that stable any more. Throughout the
simulation, inefficient periods appear consistently. Upon closer inspection, these inefficient periods are due
to aggressive strategies in the population. With this result, we would like to offer a way on a priori ground
to explain why there is not always fairness in dividing a pie, and different societies may have different ways
of sharing it.
